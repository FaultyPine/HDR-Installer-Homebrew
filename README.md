# HDR Installer
  
Big thanks to Genwald and all contributors to [UltimateModManager](https://github.com/ultimate-research/UltimateModManager). This codebase is based off that project, and without it, we wouldn't be where we are today. Thanks!

Another massive thanks to [Blujay](https://twitter.com/jayblu_), who rewrote this entire project for the better, helped me out with it on numerous occasions, and is in general an absolute chad.

# Usage
To use this app, simply download the HDR_Installer.nro file from the [releases page of this repo](https://github.com/FaultyPine/HDR-Installer-Homebrew/releases), and put that file in your "switch" folder on your SD card. Then open the homebrew menu and select the app.

 Using pacman (installed with devkitpro) install the following libraries:

( Note: This is my first C++ project ever! I know the organization and general design of this codebase is quite un-elegant and messy, 
and because I'm so new at this lang, all feedback and critisism is absolutely welcome in any form, I'm looking to learn! )
