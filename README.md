# HDR Installer
A homebrew application to install HewDraw Remix and its addons.
  
Big thanks to Genwald and all contributors to [UltimateModManager](https://github.com/ultimate-research/UltimateModManager). This codebase is based off that project, and without it, we wouldn't be where we are today. Thanks!
  
  
This installer installs mods from this repository

Feel free to submit a PR with your own romfs mod there to have it featured on the installer!
  
  
# Build
  
Install [Devkitpro](https://devkitpro.org/wiki/Getting_Started).
  
 Using pacman (installed with devkitpro) install the following libraries:
* switch-curl
  
  
  
  
( Note: This is my first C++ project ever! I know the organization and general design of this codebase is quite un-elegant and messy, 
and because I'm so new at this lang, all feedback and critisism is absolutely welcome in any form, I'm looking to learn! )
